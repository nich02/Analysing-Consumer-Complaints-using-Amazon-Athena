# Analysing-Consumer-Complaints-using-Amazon-Athena
This Project uses 

Business Case (Situation)
In this project I case of a customer support working in a multinational company which offer services to different states and countries. To improve customer engagements, enhance consumer trust and minimize customer churn, the head of data analytics asks me to perform SQL Query analysis on consumer_complaints data archived in Amazon S3. 
In the project I assumed the role of a Data Scientist, Business Intelligence Analyst or even a Data Analyst. The business question was to answer 6 questions using Amazon Athena query editor using the US_consumer_complaints data which is available at Kaggle. 
I decided to perform few SQL Queries in Amazon Athena query editor. The first step was to load data from Amazon S3 to Athena for querying. The process involved use of Amazon Glue (which is an ETL tool for data transfer). With Amazon Glue I was able to load US_consumer_complaints data from S3 to Amazon Athena for analysis.
