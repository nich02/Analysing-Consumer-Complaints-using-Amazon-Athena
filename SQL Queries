To test successful connection of my table I decided to write the following query on the Amazon Athena SQL editor. 
SELECT * FROM consumercomplaint LIMIT =10;
Objective 1. Display how many complaints were respondent on time
SELECT * FROM consumercomplaint WHERE timely_response = 'Yes';

Objective 2. Using SQL query get only consumer complaints that were closed with monetary relief. 
SELECT date_received, product, issue, company, state FROM consumercomplaint WHERE company_response_to_consumer = 'Closed with monetary relief';

Objective 3. Letâ€™s understand the major channels of communication such as Web and Emails and then arrange them in ascending order. 
SELECT date_received, product, issue, company, state, submitted_via FROM consumercomplaint WHERE submitted_via = 'Email' OR submitted_via = 'Web' ORDER BY date_received ASC;

Objective 4. How many complaints were associated with Mortgage?
SELECT COUNT (*) FROM consumercomplaint WHERE product = 'Mortgage'; 

SELECT * FROM consumercomplaint WHERE issue LIKE 'Credit%';

SELECT * FROM consumercomplaint WHERE date_received='06/13/2013';

SELECT * FROM consumercomplaint WHERE issue LIKE 'Credit%';

SELECT * FROM consumercomplaint WHERE date_received='06/13/2013';

SELECT date_received, product, issue, company, state, submitted_via FROM consumercomplaint WHERE issue LIKE 'Credit%' AND date_received BETWEEN '06/13/2013' AND '09/24/2013';

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM   employees AS Total_Employees,

SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Bank Issues" FROM consumercomplaint WHERE product= 'Credit card';

SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Timely Respondent" FROM consumercomplaint WHERE timely_response= 'Yes';
